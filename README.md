# Vulnerability Scanning using OpenVAS

The repository demostrate how to run a vulnerability scans against a target host system using OpenVAS.
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
Verify the connectivity of the target host using the ping command

<h3>Step 2:</h3>
Start the vulnerability assessment tool (OpenVAS) using the command ovsetup to launch it, and input the login credential on the login interface displayed in the browser.

<h3>Step 3:</h3>
After successful login, a dashboard will be display showing the OpenVAS dashboard.

<h3>Step 4:</h3>
Start a new scanning of the target host system by clicking the new icon showing at the top left corner highlighted with red colour

<h3>Step 5:</h3>
After clicking the new icon, a new task dialog box is displayed. Enter the task name, scan target ip address and other necessary parameters then click save as depicted in the below image

<h3>Step 6:</h3>
After clicking save from the previous step, you will be redirected back to the dashboard which will display the task name (i.e the name you save your task with, however, in this example, Kazeemtarget is used as the Task name) and the target host system is ready to be scanned after all configuration settings. click on the task name to preview the settings before starting the scan or click on the play icon to start the scan and this will also displays the progress of the vulnerability scanning as displayed in image below.

Preview settings after click the task new (KazeemWeb)

<h3>Step 7:</h3>
The vulnerability scan will start and the play icon will change to stop icon. However, The scanning progress starts from 0% and ends at 100%.

<h3>Step 8:</h3>
The report of the scan will be displayed after the scanning process ends and scanning report will be displaedy which can then be exported into pdf or any oter readable format.

Vulnerability Assessment PDF Report<br/>
----------------------------------- Vulnerability Result ----------------------------------<br/>
The below Table 5 show the output result of vulnerabilities discovered on the target host system i.e. 172.19.3.92 after scanning and are classified based on their CVSS scores, impact, risk level. However, suggestion on how to mitigate or eradicate these vulnerabilities is discussed.
Table 5: Overall OpenVAS Scan Overview

S/N	NAME	Service (Port)	Threat Level	CVSS Scores
1.	FTP	21/TCP	Medium	6.4
2.	HTTP	80/TCP	Medium	4.8
3.	TELNET	23/TCP	Medium	4.8 <br/>
Find attach with this repo the document explaining this vulnerabilities and ways to mitigate or eradicate them.
